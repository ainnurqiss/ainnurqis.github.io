        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Beyond academics, I love coding personal projects, solving coding challenges, and designing UI prototypes. 
            I find UI/UX design fascinating, as it allows me to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. 
            I also enjoy participating in hackathons, exploring new technologies, and improving my problem-solving skills.
            In my free time, I enjoy reading novels and manhwas as it allows me to explore different worlds, ideas, and perspectives.
            Whether it's fiction, mystery, or sci-fi, reading helps me relax and enhances my creativity.

            Outside of tech and reading, I have a passion for gaming, photography, and music. Gaming helps me unwind
            and think strategically, while photography allows me to capture creativity in a different form. 
            Music is another big part of my life, providing both relaxation and inspiration.</p>
